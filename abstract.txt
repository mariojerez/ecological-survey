Sets are a powerful but often underemphasized data structure in introductory Python courses. This assignment introduces sets through a real-world ecological survey scenario in which biologists log species sightings at multiple sites and would like an intuitive way to engage with the data that they collect. Students are tasked with designing a console-based tool to answer queries such as "Which species are common across these sites?" or "Which species are unique to location A?" Throughout this project, students will enhance their understanding of how sets can be useful while practicing other skills, such as reading files, using dictionaries, parsing user input, and utilizing conditionals to redirect flow to the correct function calls.
